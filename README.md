spotify current track to csgo chat very nice

# How to use
1. Login to your Spotify account (Don't forget to use "Remember me" option)
2. Select your Steam account in "current acc" list
3. Enter desired chat button (If you run into any trouble setting one, you can press the "!keys" button to see the Source engine keys)
4. Optionally, you can use autosend, which activates send button on each change of track via WinAPI SendInput
5. Turn on the program by switching the "npc work" slider on
6. Copy the console string
7. Paste console string into the csgo console (~) (bind "%assignedkey%" "exec audio.cfg")
8. Press the assigned key to send current track info or use the autosend option mentioned in the 4th step

Make sure to not be in any kind of a in-game menu or alt-tabbed when using autosend to prevent it not sending input to the game when the track has changed.
